## 🚨 CASH FLOW REALITY CHECK

### **Worst Case Scenario: 0 Revenue**

If you launch and get ZERO subscribers for the first month:

| Period | Daily Cost | Covered by Replit? | Your Cost |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Week 1** (testing) | $0.20 - $0.50 | ✅ YES | **$0** |
| **Week 2** (100 users) | $0.50 - $1.00 | ✅ YES | **$0** |
| **Week 3** (500 users) | $1.50 - $2.50 | ⚠️ PARTIAL | **$0.50 - $1.50/day** |
| **Week 4** (1,000 users) | $2.50 - $5.00 | ❌ NO | **$2.50 - $5.00/day** |

**Worst case monthly loss**: $75 - $150  
**Covered by**: Your Replit subscription partially

**BUT**: If you get just **10 subscribers** in Month 1:
- Revenue: 10 × $20 = $200/month
- Your cut: $104/month
- **You're profitable!**
