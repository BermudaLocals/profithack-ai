00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,020
Hello there.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,390
In this video, I will discuss about what is Chad Djibouti, Right.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:16,500
Since the opening night released its blockbuster Bow tie in Heart in November 2020.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:25,770
To that Pools has sparked ongoing Caswell experiments, including some by reporter trying to simulate

5
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,480
news stories or mass potential deaths.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,060
Open air chiefs Sam Altman said on Twitter.

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,220
Chad Djibouti launched on Wednesday to day.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,740
It scores 1 million users.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,330
Really awesome.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,380
Altmann told mask average is probably single digit percent.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,540
Trying to figure out more.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,730
More precisely and also how we can optimize.

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:13,550
So, Chad, Djibouti are powered by large amount of data and computing technique to make predictions

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,500
about stringing world together in a meaningful way.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:29,460
Chat deputy can be used to write and edit letters, memos, stories, journals and one other via human

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:29,940
problem.

17
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:39,240
It currently responds to prompt in the English language, but can translate right off in the other languages

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,440
into English.

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:50,500
Similarly, other tech companies like Google and Metra have developed their own large language model

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:00,640
tools with use programs that response to human prompts and devise sophisticated responses.

21
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:13,060
Openai is a revolutionary move, also created a user interface that is leading the general public,

22
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,630
experimenting with it directly.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,500
The chat bot currently use technology like Google Dialogflow.

24
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,020
Another large language model tool.

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:38,000
Also, GPT is coming for classroom, hospital, marketing department and everything else as the next

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,800
great startup boom emerges.

27
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:56,060
It has been reported that a based on a student build an F we can detect if chat gpt oth and essay to

28
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,930
combat AI based plagiarism.

29
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:12,020
You can access GPT simply by visiting openai dot com or chat dot openai dot com and creating an openai

30
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,890
account.

31
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,140
You can use CBT to start chatting after logging.

32
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,650
Ask a question is a wonderful approach to start a conversation.

33
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:38,680
You can use Djibouti for free and as many times as you like, because it's still in the reserve systems.

34
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,790
How does it work?

35
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,540
With an understanding of what is Jeopardy.

36
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,090
Let's explore how it works at its foundation.

37
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,580
Djibouti is a chad, Djibouti three and Chad.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Djibouti 3.5 based last language model.

39
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:14,180
This AI tool applies machine learning algorithm to a massive corpus of text to response to user request

40
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,480
using words that sound surprisingly like human.

41
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:30,900
According to Openai, to enhance its capacity through reinforcement reinforcement learning.

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,140
We depend on human feedback.

43
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:45,640
The business hired human trainers to interact with the model while assume the roles of both a user and

44
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,230
a chat bot.

45
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,070
Right.

46
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:59,940
So trainers compare a response given by CBT to human replace and get their quality to reinforce like

47
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,340
human conversation across.

48
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:10,920
Hope Do you understand what is good and how good you are were.

49
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,990
Thanks for watching this video.
