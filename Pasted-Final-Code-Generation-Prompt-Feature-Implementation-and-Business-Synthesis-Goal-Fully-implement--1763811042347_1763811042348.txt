Final Code Generation Prompt - Feature Implementation and Business Synthesis

Goal: Fully implement and configure all core profithackai features, including the newly introduced advanced features, to work seamlessly within the completed microservices architecture. Upon completion, the Replit AI must provide a comprehensive business analysis.

Prerequisite: All previous architectural and operational prompts (Part 1, Part 2, Part 4, Go-Live) must be successfully completed.

1. Full Feature Implementation and Configuration

Task: Implement the full, working logic for all features, ensuring they utilize the new Golang, Kafka, and XAI services and maintain the "better than" look and feel.

Deliverables:

1.
Core Feature Logic Integration:

•
Video Feed/Tube/Vids/Discover: Implement the full logic in the Golang feed-service to serve content based on the XAI recommendations, including filtering for the new Battles and Discover features.

•
Dating/Rizz: Implement the full matching and "Rizz" logic within the Golang service, utilizing the NoSQL database for swipe history and the XAI service for advanced matching.

•
Messaging/DMs/Calls: Implement the full logic for end-to-end encrypted DMs and secure WebRTC calls, ensuring the WhatsApp-style reliability and security.

•
OnlyFans/Marketplace: Implement the full logic for premium content access, virtual gift economy, and the creator marketplace, ensuring all 7+ payment processors are fully integrated and functional.



2.
Advanced Feature Implementation:

•
Sora 2 AI / Video Editing: Implement the full logic for the Sora 2 AI feature, utilizing the existing FFmpeg service to process and generate high-quality video content.

•
AI Twin / 200 Agents: Implement the full logic for the AI Twin generation and the 200 Agents system, ensuring they can interact with users via messaging and the Creator Studio.

•
Replit-Style Workflow: Fully implement the logic for the Collaborative Coding/Live Share feature within the Monaco Editor/Terminal, utilizing WebSockets for real-time synchronization.



3.
UI/UX Final Polish:

•
Apply final CSS/Tailwind polish to all components to ensure the look and feel is better than the emulated sites (TikTok, WhatsApp, OnlyFans, YouTube, Dating Apps) and that the user transition is seamless.



2. Business and Technical Synthesis

Task: After confirming all features are implemented and working, the Replit AI must provide a comprehensive analysis of the final product.

Deliverables:

1.
Pressure Prompt Rating:

•
Provide a single integer rating from 1 to 6 (1-3 is bad, 4-6 is great) for the final product's overall readiness and potential.



2.
Viability Check (Go/No-Go):

•
Provide a concise, two-paragraph summary of the final product's viability, explicitly stating whether it is a Go for launch or No-Go and why. This must include a summary of the technical resilience and feature superiority.



3.
Per-Week Revenue Potential:

•
Provide a calculated estimate of the Per-Week Revenue Potential based on the $63 million per month goal, the hyper-monetization features, and the global-scale architecture. The estimate should be presented as a range (e.g., "$X to $Y per week").



Final Action: The Replit AI should present the final analysis in a clear, professional Markdown table format.
