You name it, I tried it. And then I did
it. My app Make tune went viral. like
proper viral, 800,000 views on X, 18,000
downloads, and
1,650 trial activations, all within 3
days. In this video, I'm going to share
the simple strategy I use to market my
viral app and how it only cost
$1,299. In my previous video, I talked
about the psychology of design when
creating a viral app. Go check it out.
I'll put a link in the description
below. The first step to the simple
strategy for building a viral app, be
first. When Chat GPT released their 40
image generation model, the internet was
taken over by anime styled photos and
memes. So, I set out with a simple aim.
Turn this into an app. Ride the viral
wave, be the first to market, and
hopefully win. And I got there. Within a
day, the app was built, released, and
announced. I'd stayed up until 4:00 a.m.
and then waited another 12 hours for the
App Store to finally approve it. But it
was worth it. Being first gave me a head
start and got a viral boost on X. But
the trickiest part, identifying trends.
I kind of cheated when I made this one.
I was already making my first viral app
called Remove My X, which used these
same image generation models to remove
your ex from photos. Hint, it didn't go
viral. Instead, I pivoted to build Make
Tune, the app that lets you turn
yourself into a cartoon. I recycled the
same code base, repackaged it up, and
released it. But I learned a valuable
lesson from the Remove My X app. With
that app, I was entirely focused on
viral marketing. App store optimization
was absolutely
nonexistent. This app relied 100% on
content marketing and there was no
fallback or second chances when it
flopped. With make tune, it was going to
be different. This would be built on
researching keywords and I would invest
time and money on branding. I made a
logo and I bought the premium domain
name. When someone shared a photo from
the app, they would see the MakeTune
logo and that domain name. The aim, ride
the viral wave, get an influx of initial
downloads, and hopefully build a
sustainable app brand that outlives the
latest craze. If you're not investing
time in building an audience, then what
are you doing? It should be your primary
marketing channel. No, you're not
promoting your app or your services.
you're actually promoting your personal
brand. You hear it often, they did it
because they have an audience. Well,
that's not entirely true. A bad idea is
still a bad idea, even if you have an
audience. But having an audience means a
good idea gets out there fast. And a bad
idea fails even faster. It lets you
iterate and quickly move on. If you're
aiming for virality, you need an
audience. It's as simple as that. But
that sounds like a massive copout. Here
I am telling you the secret to marketing
your app is to spend 5 years building an
audience of 30,000 followers on X. But
check out Mario. He was one of the many
who jumped on this wave of tune apps.
And there's a lot of them. His app turn
anime was built at the same time and he
followed the exact same strategy. He
tweeted every step of the way to his
audience of
4,242 followers. The result, 50
downloads a day and a projected monthly
revenue of 750 to
$1,500. But there was another side
effect I noticed with Mario. He became
an authority on building trendy AI apps
because of his eagerness to help others
and share his secret source. The app
itself might go on to be a massive money
maker, or it could just simply be a
stepping stone for his own personal
brand and following growth. And then
check out Ammani. He was a few weeks
late to the party and was about to give
up entirely, but pushed through anyway.
He launched with over 1,000 followers a
day. I bet he's glad he stayed in the
race. Again, his strategy was simple.
Tweet every step of the journey, the
lessons that were learned and daily
progress to his audience of
5,346. It helps that these apps are
trendy and a lot more fun to talk about
than just showing code snippets or
discussing frameworks. When I think of
an app going viral, my view has been
limited about Tik Tok, Instagram res,
and shorts. But it turns out you can do
it with X, too. And if you're a
developer passionate about building
already, then it's not that hard to just
talk about it on X. You just have to
swallow that part that says someone is
going to steal your ideas and realize
anyone with access to AI can do it
anyway. If you want me to create a full
video on how I grew my Twitter account
to 30,000 plus followers, let me know in
the comments below. I'll give you a
quick overview. Show up every day. Don't
sell to your audience. provide value to
other developers. Encourage and be
encouraged and leave your personal drama
at home. X is a great place to find
ideas and to build your personal brand.
If you share what you're building and
you're passionate, you will find
like-minded people being attracted to
your work. The more value you give, the
more you are retweeted and shared. You
can spin up the algorithm into a frenzy
when you're racing to be the first to a
trend. Just share what you're building
and provide every single element of it.
It's called building in public. And
while building make tune, this is
exactly what I did. I posted the
prompts, outline the plan, show the
strategy. You name it, I did it. And
yes, people will copy, but there's room
in this game for everyone. I find
lifting them up, sharing the spotlight
works. Repost when someone started to
work on the same idea as you. By the
time you launch, your posts are
everywhere. And I mean everywhere.
You've created anticipation, excitement,
but you got to launch
