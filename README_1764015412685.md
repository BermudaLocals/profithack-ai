# ELITE2026 AI Creator Platform

This project has been transformed into a deployable Node.js/TypeScript backend for an AI Influencer Creator Platform. It uses Express.js and is designed to integrate with the Anthropic AI SDK for content generation.

## Project Status: Deployable with Mocked AI

Due to a technical issue with the Anthropic SDK during development, the AI service is currently **mocked**. This means the application will build, run, and respond to API calls, but the content will be a placeholder.

**To enable the real AI, you must follow the instructions in the "Enabling the Real AI Service" section below.**

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

The application uses the `dotenv` package. You must set the following variables in your hosting environment or in a local `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | The port the Express server will listen on. | `3000` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **REQUIRED for Real AI.** Your API key for the Anthropic AI SDK. | `sk-ant-api03-xxxx` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | (Optional) The connection string for the PostgreSQL database. | `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database` |

### 2. Running the Application

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on the configured `PORT` (default: 3000).

### 3. API Endpoint for Content Generation

The application exposes a single endpoint for generating content:

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/content/generate`
*   **Content-Type:** `application/json`

**Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "personaName": "Lexi",
  "personaDescription": "A confident, playful fitness model who loves sharing her daily life and workout tips.",
  "contentTopic": "A new gym outfit and a quick motivational message.",
  "tone": "flirty",
  "length": "short"
}
```

**Response Body Example:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "persona": "Lexi",
  "topic": "A new gym outfit and a quick motivational message.",
  "content": "..." // The AI-generated text content
}
```

## Customizing the AI Influencer Persona

The AI's behavior is entirely controlled by the `personaDescription` you send in the API request.

| Component | Location | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Persona** | Request Body (`personaDescription`) | The AI's permanent identity, background, and speaking style. **You can make this as detailed as you need.** |
| **Specific Action** | Request Body (`contentTopic`, `tone`, `length`) | The specific instruction for the current post. |

## Enabling the Real AI Service

To switch from the mocked service to the real Anthropic AI, you need to edit the file `src/core/AIService.ts`.

1.  **Open the file:** `elite2026/src/core/AIService.ts`
2.  **Uncomment the Anthropic SDK code:**
    *   **Remove the `/*` and `*/`** around the **REAL ANTHROPIC AI LOGIC** block (starting around line 35).
    *   **Comment out the MOCKED RESPONSE** block (starting around line 28).
3.  **Re-add the necessary imports:**
    *   **Uncomment the imports** at the top of the file:
        ```typescript
        import { Anthropic } from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";
        import { MessageParam } from "@anthropic-ai/sdk/resources";
        ```
    *   **Uncomment the client initialization:**
        ```typescript
        const anthropic = new Anthropic();
        ```
4.  **Rebuild:** Run `npm run build` again.

Once these changes are made and you have set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the application will use the real AI model to generate content based on your persona instructions.
