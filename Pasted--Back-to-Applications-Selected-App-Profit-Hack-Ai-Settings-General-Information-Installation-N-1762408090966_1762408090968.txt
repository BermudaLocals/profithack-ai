Getting Started
OAuth2
Use Discord as an authorization system or use our API on behalf of your users. Add a redirect URI, pick your scopes, roll a D20 for good luck, and go!

Public Client
Public clients cannot maintain the confidentiality of their client credentials (i.e. desktop/mobile applications that do not use a server to make requests)
Redirects
You must specify at least one URI for authentication to work. If you pass a URI in an OAuth request, it must exactly match one of the URIs you enter here.

OAuth2 URL Generator
Generate an invite link for your application by picking the scopes and permissions it needs to function. Then, share the URL to others!
