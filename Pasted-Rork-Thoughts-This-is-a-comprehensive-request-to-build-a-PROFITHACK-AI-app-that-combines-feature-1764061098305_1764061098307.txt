Thoughts
This is a comprehensive request to build a "PROFITHACK AI" app that combines features from TikTok, OnlyFans, Tinder, and AI tools. Let me analyze what needs to be built:
Key Features:
1. Bottom Navigation (5 tabs): Home, Inbox, Create (+), AI Hub, Profile
2. Home/Video Feed: Full-screen vertical video feed (TikTok-style)
3. Live Streams: Grid of live streams
4. Inbox: WhatsApp-style messaging
5. Chat: Bubble messages with calls
6. Create: Video recording/upload
7. AI Hub: Multiple AI tools (Chat, Video Generator, Influencer Creator, Viral Hooks, etc.)
8. Dating: Tinder-style swipe cards
9. Profile: User profile with stats
10. Wallet: Credits system
Design System:
Black background (#000)
Pink (#FF1493), Purple (#8B5CF6), Cyan (#00D4FF)
Gradients: pink→purple
Inter/Poppins font
24px radius
Packages needed:
expo-router ✓
expo-av
expo-camera ✓
@gorhom/bottom-sheet
react-native-deck-swiper
react-native-reanimated ✓
zustand
@tanstack/react-query
lucide-react-native ✓
This is the first message, so I need to:
1. Think about what the user wants
2. List the inspiration and design approach
3. List the features for the first version (not too much)
4. Make sure it's beautiful and works

Let me think about a good first version:
Bottom navigation with 5 tabs
Home tab with video feed (mock videos)
Inbox with message list
Create button (simple UI)
AI Hub with grid of tools
Profile with stats
Beautiful design with specified colors
Mock data to demonstrate the UI
I'll focus on implementing the AI Hub section with a visually appealing grid of AI-powered tools. The grid will showcase various creative tools like video generation, chat interfaces, and content creation assistants. I'll use the specified color palette of pink, purple, and cyan to create an eye-catching design that stands out. Each tool will have a unique icon and brief description to entice users to explore the AI capabilities.
I'll build PROFITHACK AI - an incredibly ambitious creator platform combining TikTok's video feed, modern messaging, Tinder-style dating, and powerful AI tools for content creators.
Design Inspiration
This evokes platforms like:
TikTok - immersive full-screen video feed with engagement mechanics
Instagram - clean grid layouts and story aesthetics
Tinder - swipeable card interfaces
Discord/Telegram - modern messaging with rich features
Notion - organized dashboard for AI tools
The dark theme (#000) with vibrant pink (#FF1493), purple (#8B5CF6), and cyan (#00D4FF) gradients will create a premium, high-energy aesthetic perfect for a creator economy platform.
First Version Features
For this initial version, I'll implement:
1. ✨ Bottom Navigation - 5 tabs with custom centered Create button
2. 🎥 Video Feed - Full-screen vertical scrolling with engagement UI
3. 💬 Inbox - Modern message list 
4. 🤖 AI Hub - Dashboard grid with 8 AI tools
5. 👤 Profile - Stats and content grid
6. 🎨 Beautiful Design System - Gradients, animations, premium feel
