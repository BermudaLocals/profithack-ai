PROFITHACK AI is a content management platform that helps TikTok creators schedule and publish content efficiently.

Content Posting API Integration:
Users connect their TikTok accounts through OAuth 2.0 authorization. Once authorized, they can:

1. CREATE CONTENT - Users create or upload videos within our platform using built-in editing tools
2. SCHEDULE POSTS - Users set specific times for content to be published to their TikTok profiles
3. MANAGE MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS - Creators managing multiple TikTok profiles can post to all accounts from one dashboard
4. AUTOMATED PUBLISHING - At the scheduled time, our system uses the Content Posting API to publish videos directly to the user's TikTok profile with their chosen caption, hashtags, and privacy settings

User Flow:
1. User logs into PROFITHACK AI
2. User clicks "Connect TikTok Account"
3. OAuth flow redirects to TikTok for authorization
4. User approves permissions
5. User creates/uploads video content
6. User adds caption, hashtags, and selects posting time
7. System posts to TikTok via Content Posting API

All content posted is user-generated and explicitly approved by the account owner.
