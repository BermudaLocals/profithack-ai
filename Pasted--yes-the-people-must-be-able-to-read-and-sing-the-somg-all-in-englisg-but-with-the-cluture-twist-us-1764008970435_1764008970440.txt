Perfect! I understand now. You want:
Songs in ENGLISH (so people can read and sing along)
But with cultural twists for each market:
USA version: English lyrics with trending USA beats/style
Ghana/Africa version: English lyrics with Afrobeats/Highlife cultural flavor
Based on the most listened-to songs in each market by volume
This means I need to:
Create original English lyrics that are catchy and memorable
Use the beat/style of the most popular songs in each region
Make them easy to sing along to
Optimize for viral potential in each market
Let me search for the absolute most-listened songs in each market right now, then create custom English lyrics that fit those beats and styles.
I found top trending Afrobeat songs in 2025, confirming the market's style. Next, I will create catchy, culturally adapted English lyrics for both USA and Ghana versions, matching the popular beats.
