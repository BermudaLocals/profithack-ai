PROFITHACK AI helps TikTok creators schedule and publish content using the Content Posting API.

How It Works:
1. Users connect TikTok accounts via OAuth 2.0
2. Users create/upload videos using our editing tools
3. Users add captions, hashtags, and set posting times
4. Our system publishes videos to TikTok at scheduled times

Key Features:
• Video creation and editing tools
• Schedule posts for specific times
• Manage multiple TikTok accounts from one dashboard
• Automated publishing with user-defined captions, hashtags, and privacy settings

User Flow:
1. Log into PROFITHACK AI
2. Click "Connect TikTok Account"
3. Authorize via TikTok OAuth
4. Create/upload video
5. Add caption, hashtags, select time
6. System publishes to TikTok via Content Posting API

All content is user-generated and explicitly approved by the account owner.

Upload at least one demo video that shows the complete end-to-end flow of the integration with TikTok. *

Upload
Accepted formats: mp4, mov
Maximum 5 files, up to 50MB each
For example, it should demonstrate how you use TikTok for Developers' capabilities, such as Login Kit, Share Kit, Display API, Content Posting API, and the relevant scopes.
If your app has not been approved before, you are required to use a sandbox environment on the Developer Portal to demonstrate the integration.
The demo video should showcase the website or app where the features will actually be integrated.
All selected products and scopes must be clearly demonstrated in the video. If you don't need certain products or scopes, make sure to remove them before review. Otherwise, it will delay the review result.
The video should clearly show the user interface and user interactions.
If you intend to integrate with a web app, make sure the domain of the website shown in the demo video matches the website URL you provide.
If you intend to integrate with a mobile app, the demo video should start by showing the app being opened.
Please upload at least one video
