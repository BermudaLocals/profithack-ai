Final Integration and Polish Prompt - Frontend and Backend

Goal: Use the detailed tiktok_design_spec.md as the definitive blueprint to apply final polish, styling, and integration logic to both the frontend and backend, ensuring the application is visually superior, fully functional, and ready for production launch.

Prerequisite: All architectural skeletons (Golang, Kafka, XAI) and core feature logic are in place. The tiktok_design_spec.md file is available in the root directory.

1. Frontend (UI/UX) Finalization

Task: Refine all React/TypeScript components to perfectly match the visual and interaction specifications in tiktok_design_spec.md.

Deliverables:

1.
Full-Screen Video Feed Polish:

•
Refine the FullScreenVideoFeed.tsx component to ensure pixel-perfect alignment with the FYP layout, including semi-transparent overlays, correct font sizing, and placement of the right-side icon bar.

•
Implement gesture-based interaction logic (vertical swipe for next video, horizontal swipe for profile) with smooth, native-like transitions.



2.
Navigation Bar Implementation:

•
Implement the final, persistent Bottom Tab Bar across the application, ensuring the icons and labels match the tiktok_design_spec.md and correctly map to the profithackai features (e.g., Home -> Video Feed, Profile -> Creator Studio).



3.
Effects and Sounds Integration:

•
Implement the frontend UI for a comprehensive Effects and Sounds Library within the video creation suite, allowing users to browse, preview, and select filters, effects, and licensed audio tracks.



4.
Augmentation Integration:

•
Implement the final UI/UX for the Dating/Rizz feature integration (e.g., the subtle horizontal swipe or dedicated button) and the Creator Studio (Monaco Editor/Terminal) access point from the Profile screen.



2. Backend (Integration) Finalization

Task: Implement the final API endpoints and logic to support the polished frontend and ensure all data flows are optimized for the new UI/UX.

Deliverables:

1.
Golang Feed Service Optimization:

•
Optimize the Golang feed-service gRPC response to include all necessary metadata for the polished UI (e.g., user profile picture URL, video aspect ratio, music title, and the XAI explanation text).



2.
Agents-to-FYP Content Seeding Logic:

•
Implement a final logic hook in the 200 Agents System to automatically trigger the video upload and processing pipeline (via BullMQ) for all generated content.

•
Ensure all agent-generated videos are tagged with the designated "Founders Account" user ID before being inserted into the content database, guaranteeing immediate visibility on the FYP.



3.
API Gateway (Node.js) Refinement:

•
Review and refine all Node.js/Express API gateway endpoints to ensure they correctly translate the polished frontend requests into gRPC calls to the Golang service and back, with minimal latency overhead.



4.
Effects and Sounds Processing Integration:

•
Modify the FFmpeg-based Video Processing Service to accept metadata for selected effects and sounds and apply them during the final video rendering and transcoding process.



5.
Video Processing Status Integration:

•
Implement a final API endpoint in the Node.js service that allows the frontend to query the real-time status of a video upload (e.g., "Processing," "Transcoding," "Ready") from the FFmpeg service, providing a smooth user experience in the Video Creation/Editing Suite.



3. Final Code Review and Cleanup

Task: Perform a final pass to ensure code quality and production readiness.

Deliverables:

1.
Dead Code Removal: Remove all placeholder code, dummy data, and unused imports from the entire codebase.

2.
TypeScript Strictness: Ensure all new and modified TypeScript files pass strict type checking without errors.

3.
Final Documentation Update: Update the main README.md to reflect the final, polished state of the application and its superior architecture.

Final Action: The Replit AI should confirm that the application is now visually and functionally complete according to the tiktok_design_spec.md and ready for the final Go-Live security audit.
