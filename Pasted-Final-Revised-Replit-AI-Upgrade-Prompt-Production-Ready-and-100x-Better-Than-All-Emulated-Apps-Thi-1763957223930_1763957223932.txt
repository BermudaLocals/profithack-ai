Final Revised Replit AI Upgrade Prompt: Production-Ready and 100x Better Than All Emulated Apps

This prompt is the definitive guide for Replit's AI to transform the existing project, PROFITHACK AI, into a production-ready, global-scale, hyper-optimized platform that is architecturally and functionally 100x better than all emulated apps, including TikTok and the integrated dating app functionality. All existing features must be retained and seamlessly integrated.

1. Project Context and Ultimate Goal

Existing Technology Stack (Must be Retained and Integrated):

•
Frontend: React 18.3.1 (TypeScript), Wouter, TanStack Query v5, Shadcn UI + Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor, xterm.js.

•
Backend: Node.js/Express 4.21.2 (TypeScript/tsx), PostgreSQL (Neon), Drizzle ORM 0.39.1, BullMQ 5.63.0 (Redis), WebSockets (ws), WebRTC (Mediasoup/Twilio), AWS S3.

•
Existing Features to Retain: TikTok-Style Video Feed, 1-on-1 Video Calls, Messaging, Live Streaming, Virtual Gift Economy, Premium Subscriptions (OnlyFans-style), AI Lab Workspace, Multi-Payment Support (8+ providers).

Ultimate Goal: Build a Zero-Downtime, Multi-Region, Polyglot Persistence system with a Programmable Content feature and an Explainable AI recommendation engine, resulting in a platform that is 100x better than TikTok, OnlyFans, and any dating app in every measurable way.

2. Architectural & Performance Augmentations (Production-Ready Core)

The following changes implement the production-ready, superior architecture:

A. Polyglot Persistence and Concurrency

1.
Core Service Migration (Golang): Create a new feed-service using Golang and gRPC. This service will handle all high-concurrency feed generation, real-time user interaction logic, and dating/matching algorithms with sub-10ms latency.

2.
Database Expansion (Polyglot):

•
Integrate Redis Cluster for all caching, session management, and leaderboards.

•
Integrate a NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra) for massive, unstructured data storage (video metadata, comments, user swipe/match history).



3.
Data Pipeline (Kafka/Flink Skeleton): Set up the skeleton for an Apache Kafka message queue and a Flink-like stream processing service to process user activity (views, likes, swipes, match requests) in real-time and update Redis features.

B. Video Processing and Delivery Pipeline (Crucial for Existing Video Compatibility)

1.
Decoupled Video Service with Compatibility Check: Create a dedicated, asynchronous service (triggered by BullMQ) that runs a C/C++-optimized FFmpeg container. This service must:

•
Transcode all existing and new videos to multiple adaptive streaming formats (H.264/H.265) to ensure 100% compatibility with the new system and all mobile devices.

•
Apply dynamic, non-removable watermarking.

•
Extract detailed metadata (color palette, motion vectors) for the ML engine.



2.
Global CDN Configuration: Configure the existing AWS S3-compatible storage to integrate with a Global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for ultra-low latency video streaming.

C. Production Readiness and Observability

1.
Observability Instrumentation: Instrument all new and existing services (Node.js, Golang) with basic logging and metrics collection (e.g., using a library compatible with Prometheus/Grafana).

2.
Security Skeleton (mTLS): Prepare the configuration files (e.g., a basic service mesh config) to enforce Mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure service-to-service communication, establishing a Zero Trust foundation.

3. Feature Differentiation and UI/UX Implementation

The frontend must be transformed into a mobile-first experience and leverage the unique features of the existing stack.

A. Frontend UI/UX (100x Better Feel and Mobile Style)

1.
Full-Screen Video Feed: Implement a full-screen, vertical infinite scroll video feed component that perfectly mimics the seamless, gesture-based navigation of TikTok.

2.
Minimalist UI Overlay: Design a minimalist UI overlay for all core interactions (like, comment, share, profile, swipe-to-match) that is non-intrusive and prioritizes the video content.

B. Programmable Content and Explainable AI

1.
Programmable Content Feature: Integrate the existing Monaco Editor and xterm.js Terminal as a dedicated "Creator Studio" tab. The key is to create a feature that allows users to write small Python/JavaScript scripts in the editor to apply custom, dynamic effects or data visualizations to their video content.

2.
Explainable AI (XAI) for All Feeds: Implement a small, optional UI element on the video feed that displays a placeholder message for the Explainable AI feature (e.g., "Recommended because you frequently engage with content tagged 'Golang' and 'Drizzle ORM'"). This XAI must also be applied to the dating/matching feed (e.g., "Recommended because your preferred time-zone matches and you both follow 'Golang' content").

4. Deliverables

The Replit AI should deliver the following:

1.
Code Changes: All necessary code modifications to the existing Node.js/Express and React files.

2.
New Service Skeletons: Functional skeleton code for the Golang microservice, the NoSQL integration, and the FFmpeg-based Video Service.

3.
Configuration Updates: Updated configuration files for the new services, Kafka/Redis integration, and the Observability/Security placeholders.

4.
Updated Documentation: A clear summary of the architectural changes, including a diagram of the new distributed system.

Crucial Constraint: The final application must retain 100% of the functionality of the original stack while incorporating all the above production-ready augmentations.

5. Suggested Follow-Up Tasks (Next Steps for 100% Better)

Once the initial architectural upgrade is complete, the following two tasks are the most critical to achieve the "100% better" goal:

1.
Implement the Explainable AI (XAI) Recommendation Engine:

•
Goal: Replace the XAI placeholder with a functional, deep learning-based recommendation engine.

•
Task: Use the newly established Kafka/Flink data pipeline to feed real-time user activity into a PyTorch/TensorFlow model. The model should be a Two-Tower Architecture that generates user and content embeddings. The output must be a set of recommendations and the top three features that contributed to the recommendation (for the XAI display).



2.
Develop the Native Mobile Application:

•
Goal: Transition the frontend from a web-only application to a high-performance native mobile application.

•
Task: Create a new project using React Native with native modules (or Flutter/Swift/Kotlin) that consumes the high-performance Golang/gRPC feed-service. The focus should be on optimizing video playback, camera access, and gesture-based navigation to deliver a truly native, low-latency experience.
