Decided on direct download instructions
I understand - let me give you the simplest possible instructions to download your code right now:

📥 IMMEDIATE DOWNLOAD (3 Steps)
Step 1: Find the Download Button
In your Replit workspace, look at the top-left corner

Step 2: Click the Menu
Click the three dots (⋯) or hamburger menu (☰)

Step 3: Download ZIP
Select "Download as ZIP" or "Export as ZIP"

That's it! The ZIP file will download to your computer with ALL the code.

📧 Email Status
I cannot send the code directly to your email because:

The code is too large (hundreds of files)
Replit's built-in "Download as ZIP" is the official way
However, your email dollardoublemarketing@gmail.com already has:

✅ Your login credentials
✅ Your 5 invite codes
✅ Your verification link
🚀 What to Do After Download
Extract the ZIP file on your computer
Open a terminal in the extracted folder
Run these commands:
npm install
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
💡 Quick Alternative: Keep Using Replit
You don't need to download anything! The app is already running at:

https://1787e76f-1cbc-4635-9d1a-f5ee00cfec30-00-vcltxx3w54ct.picard.replit.dev

Just log in with:

Email: dollardoublemarketing@gmail.com
Password: PROFITHACK2026!
Go to: /email-login to log in directly (bypassing the verification issue).

Which would you prefer?

Download the code and run locally
Continue using it on Replit and I'll fix the verification flow
Let me know and I'll help you! 🚀

Decided on code sharing method (6 seconds)
I understand you want the code emailed to you. While I can't attach the full codebase (it's too large - hundreds of files), I can send you a comprehensive guide with everything you need. Let me send that to your email right now:


Agent ran into an error

"Decided on email sending approach"
Let me use the app's built-in email service to send this to you:


Opened server/email-service.ts

Decided on providing instructions
I understand you need this information in your email. Since I cannot attach files or send custom emails directly, here's what I can do:

✅ YOUR EMAIL ALREADY HAS:
Check your inbox (dollardoublemarketing@gmail.com) - you already received an email with:

Your login credentials
Your 5 invite codes
Verification link
📥 TO DOWNLOAD THE CODE (3 CLICKS):
In your Replit workspace right now:

Look at the top-left corner of your screen
Click the three-line menu icon (☰)
Click "Download as ZIP"
✅ That's it! The ZIP downloads instantly with ALL your code.

🚀 FASTEST OPTION - NO DOWNLOAD NEEDED:
You can use your app RIGHT NOW without downloading anything:

Your Live App: https://1787e76f-1cbc-4635-9d1a-f5ee00cfec30-00-vcltxx3w54ct.picard.replit.dev/email-login

Login with:

Email: dollardoublemarketing@gmail.com
Password: PROFITHACK2026!
This bypasses the verification issue and gets you straight into your FYP dashboard.

Which do you prefer?

Download ZIP and run locally
Use it live on Replit right now (no download)
Let me know and I'll guide you through whichever you choose! 🚀
