TikTok Mobile Application Design Specification
This document outlines the visual and functional layout of the TikTok mobile application, serving as a blueprint for the "better than TikTok" UI/UX required for the profithackai platform.
1. Core Principles of TikTok's UI/UX
TikTok's design success is built on two core principles: Immersive Content and Minimal Friction.
Immersive Content: The video is full-screen, with UI elements overlaid and semi-transparent, ensuring the content is the primary focus.
Minimal Friction: The primary interaction is a simple vertical swipe, which instantly loads the next video, minimizing decision fatigue and maximizing content consumption.
2. Main Screen: The "For You" Page (FYP)
The FYP is the heart of the application, designed for infinite consumption.

Tabs: Typically includes tabs for: Videos, Liked Videos (private), and Saved Items.
Action: A prominent "Follow" button and a "Message" button.

C. Inbox/Messaging Screen
Layout: Standard list of conversations.
Functionality: Supports text, video, and image sharing. Crucially, it must support the WhatsApp-style E2E encryption and reliability.
5. profithackai Augmentation Points
To make the layout "better," the following areas must be seamlessly integrated:
Augmentation Point
Integration Requirement
Dating/Rizz
A subtle Horizontal Swipe on the FYP must transition to the dating feed, or a dedicated Rizz button must be integrated into the right-side icon bar.
Replit Workflow
The Profile screen must have a prominent "Creator Studio" tab that opens the Monaco Editor/Terminal, maintaining the mobile look and feel.
Marketplace/OnlyFans
The Profile screen must clearly display subscription tiers and virtual gift balances, integrated into the existing UI without looking like an external link.
XAI/AI Twin
The AI Twin must be accessible via the Profile or Inbox screen. The XAI explanation must be a subtle overlay (e.g., a small "i" icon) on the FYP.
