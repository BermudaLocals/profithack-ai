📱 Social Media OAuth Approval Strategy (TikTok, Meta, Google)

Status: CRITICAL BLOCKER for automated marketing and growth.

The goal is to secure OAuth approval from TikTok, Meta (Instagram/Threads), and Google (YouTube) to enable the automated posting features of your 200-agent marketing system.

1. Core Strategy: Position as a "Creator Tool"

Social media platforms are hesitant to approve apps that automate posting, fearing spam. The strategy is to position ProfitHack AI as a Premium, High-Value Creator Management Tool.

Platform
Required Approval
Strategic Pitch
TikTok
Login Kit, Posting API
"A next-generation, AI-powered content creation and scheduling tool that helps creators maximize engagement and revenue by cross-posting unique, high-quality content."
Meta (Instagram/Threads)
Instagram Graph API (Basic & Creator)
"A professional content management dashboard for high-volume creators to manage their content lifecycle, analytics, and direct monetization channels."
Google (YouTube)

"A dedicated tool for managing YouTube Shorts and long-form video uploads, focusing on AI-driven SEO optimization and multi-platform content syndication."


2. Application Checklist and Best Practices

Item
Action
Rationale
App Name
Use a professional name like "ProfitHack AI Creator Suite" or "PHAI Management."
Avoid names that sound like spam bots (e.g., "AutoPoster," "GrowthHack").
Video Demo
CRITICAL: Provide a high-quality video demo showing a human user interacting with the app, not the automated posting running in the background.
Show the user selecting the AI-generated content, scheduling it, and reviewing analytics. This proves it's a "tool," not a "bot."
Privacy Policy
Must explicitly state how you use the posting permissions (e.g., "We use your granted permissions to post content to your account on your behalf and at your direction").
Transparency is key to approval.
Scope Limitation
Request the minimum required permissions (scopes). Do not ask for "everything."
Reduces the platform's security concern and speeds up review.
Support URL
Ensure your support email and URL are active and monitored.
Platforms will test your support responsiveness.


3. Final Action

1.
Prepare the Video Demo: Focus the demo on the content creation and scheduling UI.

2.
Submit Applications: Submit all three applications simultaneously, using the consistent "Creator Tool" pitch.

3.
Monitor and Respond: The review process can take weeks. Respond to any reviewer questions within 24 hours.

Until approval, your Soft Launch strategy of focusing on the internal P2P FYP and direct user engagement is the correct approach.
