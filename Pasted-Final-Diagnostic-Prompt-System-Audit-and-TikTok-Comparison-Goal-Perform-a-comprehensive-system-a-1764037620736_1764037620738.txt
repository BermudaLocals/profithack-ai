Final Diagnostic Prompt - System Audit and TikTok Comparison

Goal: Perform a comprehensive system audit to verify the final state of the application against the original goal of achieving a look, feel, and function that is equal to or better than TikTok, while incorporating all profithackai features.

Prerequisite: The final_synthesis_prompt.md must have been executed, and all code changes must be complete.

1. System Overview and Functionality Check

Task: Provide a high-level summary of the final application and confirm the operational status of the core microservices.

Deliverables:

1.
Application Summary:

•
Provide a concise, one-paragraph description of the final application, including its core value proposition (e.g., "The world's first hyper-scalable, multi-modal content platform with integrated AI-driven dating and programmable content.").



2.
Microservice Status Table:

•
Generate a table listing the status of the four core services: Node.js (Frontend/API Gateway), Golang (Feed/Dating), Python (XAI), and FFmpeg (Video Processing). The status must be "Operational" or "Error" with a brief explanation.



2. TikTok Look, Feel, and Functionality Comparison

Task: Directly compare the final application's UI/UX and core features against the TikTok standard.

Deliverables:

1.
Look and Feel Audit:

•
Provide a detailed analysis of the FullScreenVideoFeed.tsx component, explicitly confirming if the look and feel is "exactly like TikTok" or "better" in terms of:

•
Vertical Infinite Scroll smoothness.

•
Minimalist UI Overlay design.

•
profithackai branding integration.





2.
Functionality Comparison Table:

•
Generate a table comparing the following core features against the TikTok standard:



Feature
TikTok Standard
profithackai Status (Working/Not Working)
Discrepancy (If Any)
Video Feed
Seamless, sub-10ms load




User Profile
Clean, accessible content tabs




Video Upload
Multi-clip editing, fast processing




Live Streaming
Low-latency, interactive




Messaging (DMs)
Simple, reliable






3. Feature Discrepancy Report

Task: Explicitly list any features that are NOT working or NOT implemented to the "better than TikTok" standard.

Deliverables:

1.
Discrepancy List:

•
Provide a bulleted list of all features that are currently not working or are placeholders that require further manual development (e.g., "Sora 2 AI is a placeholder calling the FFmpeg service, not a true generative model").



2.
Final Verdict:

•
Provide a final, one-sentence verdict on whether the application is ready for the final launch, based on the audit.



Final Action: The Replit AI should present the entire audit in a clear, professional Markdown format.
