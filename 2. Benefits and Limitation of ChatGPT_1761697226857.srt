content and also.

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,820
Limited knowledge of what and even after.

46
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:44,420
2021 Djibouti are not able to provide personal or emotional support or engages in depth conversations

47

49
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,440

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:06,080
Djibouti can generate incorrect response, confidently making it all the more difficult to trust.

51
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,900
For this reason, it is best used shadowed by a human.

52
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:24,500
So the most important risk, however, is that customer can mislead or even manipulate Djibouti to get

53
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:33,140
what they want, as I think it's the most important risk at the moment.

54
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,760
